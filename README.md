Description

In this file , I use tkinter for my front end .
There are two entity, one is admin and another one is client.
where client can see his profile , salary, and apply for his leave request.
In clent tab, he or she can also see his report or status of his/her leave request.

whereas admin can see his profile and approve or decline the client leave request.He can also add or remove employee and also update their salary.

Basically , this is a user friedly application where client can see his dashboard and contact admin for leave request and also check their status.
